# Making Music with Math
### A Guide to Synthesizing Sounds with the Wave Equation

When you pluck a guitar string, or play a key on a piano, the sound is created by a vibrating string. The [wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation) tells us how each part of a string will move at each moment in time. Using this equation, it's possible to simulate the motion of a vibrating string. In this post, we'll see how you can extract musical sounds directly from this equation.

## The Ideal String

The wave equation for an ideal string is

$$ \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} $$

or more concisely,

$$\ddot{y} = c^2 y''$$

where $c$ is the speed of the travelling wave moving along the string.

In words, this equations says that the acceleration of any point along the string is proportional to the curvature at that point. For now, we're ignoring energy dissipation from friction and any stiffness in the string, which is why we call this an ideal string. The behavior of real strings is more complicated to analyze, so we'll start simple.

The goal is to find $y(x,t)$, which tells us the height of every point along the string $(x)$ at any moment in time $(t)$.

The general solutions for the motion of a vibrating string whose ends are fixed are

$$ y_n = \sin (k_n x) \big( A_n \cos(\omega_n t) + B_n \sin(\omega_n t) \big)$$

where $k_n = \frac{n \pi}{L}$, $\omega_n = c \frac{n \pi}{L}$, $n = 1,2,3,...$, and $A_n$ and $B_n$ are coefficients to be determined.

We can verify that these solutions obeys the wave equation so long as $\omega_n^2 = c^2 k_n^2$. We can also verify that they are fixed at the ends, i.e.

$$ y_n(0,t) = 0 $$
$$ y_n(L,t) = 0 $$

The $y_n$ provided by the above equation are known as the *normal modes* of the string. These represent all the simplest possible ways in which a string can vibrate. Let's visualize what the first few of these normal modes look like.
</md>

<animation :vars="stringnormalmodes" :sliders="{n: ['Mode Number', 1, 6, 1]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, n, a, b) {
  let k = n * Math.PI;
  let c = 0.375;
  let w = c * k;

  return Math.sin(k * x) * (a * Math.sin(w * t) + b * Math.cos(w * t))/n;
}

`">
</animation>

<md>
As we increase $n$, the string oscillates more rapidly. The frequency of vibration of each normal mode $f_n$ is related to $\omega_n$ by $f_n = \frac{\omega_n}{2 \pi} = n \frac{c}{2 L} = n f$.

Notice that just by requiring the string to be fixed at its ends, the wave equation ensures that an ideal string can only vibrate at a certain allowable set of frequencies (f, 2f, 3f, ...). Together, these frequencies are known as the *harmonics* of the string.

The wave equation is a **linear equation**, which means that if $y_1$ is a solution and $y_2$ is a solution, then any combination of the form $a y_1 + b y_2$ is also a solution. So we can always put together a weighted sum of different normal modes to obtain more complex patterns of string vibration.

Just for fun, in the interactive below you can drag the sliders to mix in different amounts of the first 6 normal modes (here we're adjusting the $A_n$ coefficients, and the $B_n$ coefficients are set to zero). When you're done, turn up the speed slider to unfreeze the wave and watch the ensuing wave motion.
</md>

<animation :vars="mixingmodes" :sliders="{A1: ['1st mode', -1, 1, 0.01], A2: ['2nd mode', -1, 1, 0.01], A3: ['3rd mode', -1, 1, 0.01], A4: ['4th mode', -1, 1, 0.01], A5: ['5th mode', -1, 1, 0.01], A6: ['6th mode', -1, 1, 0.01], c: ['Speed', 0, 1, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, c, ...a) {

  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=6; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    y += Math.sin(k * x) * (a[n-1] * Math.cos(w * t))
  }

  return y/6;
}

`">
</animation>

<md>

Notice how moving the sliders alters the original shape of the string, as well as the subsequent motion. Every setting of sliders corresponds to a different, perfectly 'legal' configuration of the string.

A somewhat amazing fact is that essentially any string shape can be expressed as a sum of different normal modes. So, the most general type of string vibration is

$$
\begin{aligned}
   y &= y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + \ldots \\
   &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty y_n
\end{aligned}
$$

Or,
$$
y = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin (k_n x) \big( A_n \cos(\omega_n t) + B_n \sin(\omega_n t) \big)
$$

where $k_n = \frac{n \pi}{L}$, $\omega_n = c \frac{n \pi}{L}$, and $c$ is the speed of the travelling wave in the string.

Solving the wave equation in a particular situation amounts to working out the coefficients $A_n$ and $B_n$. Once we know these coefficients, we can plug them into the equation above to obtain a formula for the motion of every point on the string for all time.

But how do we find these coefficients? To do this, we need to know something more about the string. In particular, we need to know the **initial position** and the **initial velocity** of the string, which we can write as $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.

$$ y(x,0) = f(x) $$
$$ \dot{y}(x,0) = g(x) $$

If $g(x) = 0$, then each point on the string starts off with zero initial velocity but with some initial shape provided by $f(x)$. We call this a plucked string.

On the other hand, if $f(x) = 0$, then the string starts off completely flat, but with an initial velocity distribution provided by $g(x)$. We call this a struck strung.

Let's consider these two cases separately.

## The Plucked Ideal String

When you play a note on a guitar, you pluck the string and give it an initial shape.

The solution for the ideal plucked string reduces to

$$ y = \sum_{n=1}^\infty A_n \sin (k_n x)  \cos(\omega_n t)$$

Let's say we know the initial shape of the string, which we call $f(x)$.

$$ y(x,0) = f(x) $$

Expanding out $y$ and substituting $k_n = \frac{n \pi}{L}$,

$$ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty A_n \sin (\frac{n \pi x}{L}) $$

We want to solve this for $A_n$. Using the classic [Fourier trick](https://books.google.com/books?id=Kh4xDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA134&dq=Fourier%27s+trick+griffiths&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwib2eD80_blAhWLjFkKHY8YB9oQ6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q&f=false) and some algebraic rearrangement, we end up with an equation for $A_n$.

$$ A_n =  \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \sin (\frac{n \pi x}{L}) dx$$

This equation solves the case of the ideal plucked string.

Let's try an example. Say that the string is plucked at a length $l$ along the string, with an initially triangular string shape.

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
   h \frac{x}{l} & \text{if } x \leq l \\
   h \frac{L - x}{L - l} & \text{if } l < x \leq L
\end{cases}
$$

Here's what this function for the plucked guitar string shape looks like.</md>


<animation :vars="trianglecurve" :sliders="{l: ['Pluck position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01], h: ['Pluck height', -1, 1, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, l, h) {
  return x <= l ? h * x/l : h * (1 - x) / (1-l);
}

`"></animation>

<md>
We can plug this function into to our integral for $A_n$, and use a tool like Wolfram Alpha to solve the integral. The [solution](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282%2FL%29*%28Integrate%5Bsin%28n+pi+x+%2F+L%29+*+h*x%2Fl%2C%7Bx%2C0%2Cl%7D%5D+%2B+Integrate%5Bsin%28n+pi+x+%2F+L%29+*+h*%281-x%2FL%29*%28L%2F%28L-l%29%29%2C%7Bx%2Cl%2CL%7D%5D%29)  is

$$ A_n = \frac{1}{n^2 \pi^2} \frac{2 h L^2}{l (L- l)}  \sin(\frac{n \pi l}{L})$$

Let's animate this solution for the first $N$ terms in the sum.

$$ y(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \sin (k_n x) \cos(\omega_n t)$$

</md>

<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Pluck position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, N, l) {
  let c = 0.375;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=N; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (1/Math.pow((n*Math.PI),2)) * (2/(l * (1-l))) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    y += a * Math.sin(k * x) * Math.cos(w * t);

  }

  return y;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
The animation above shows the motion of the string following the initial pluck. Notice that the string motion is periodic, as the string returns to its starting position and repeats the motion.

The next step is to extract an audio waveform from this string motion. For the waveform $w(t)$, we want only the time-dependent part of the string motion.

$$ w(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \cos(\omega_n t)$$

</md>

<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Pluck position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, N, l) {

  let c = 0.375;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=N; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (1/Math.pow((n * Math.PI),2)) * (2/(l * (1-l))) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    y += a * Math.cos(w * x * 20);

  }

  return y/1.5;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
  The interactive above shows you the waveform for the plucked string. Notice how it changs depending on where you pluck the string.

  To make sound with this waveform, we first need to do a couple of things.

  - Rewrite $\omega_n$ in terms of the fundamental frequency of the tone, so $\omega_n = 2 \pi n f$.
  - A real plucked string has a sound that fades. To model this, we need the string to dissipate energy. One way to do this is to ensure that each sine or cosine function decays exponentially, with a decay time $\tau_n$ that depends on its frequency (higher frequencies fade faster than lower ones). Following [this reference](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2007/ph210/pelc2/), we can choose $\tau_n = \frac{\tau}{n}$ where $\tau$ is a characteristic fade time (in seconds).


  Making these changes, we end up with the following waveform.

  $$ w(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \cos(2 \pi n f t) e ^{ - n t / \tau }$$

  Here's what this sounds like.
</md>


<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Pluck position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}">

  <div class="center-inline">
    <div> Fundamental Frequency = {{freq}} </div> &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <input type="range" :min="110" :max="440" :step="1" v-model.number="freq"></input>
  </div>

  <sound :sin="pluckedString" :freq="freq" :N="string.N"></sound>

</animation>

<md>
  Notice that as the pluck position moves towards the edge of the string, the sound becomes brighter.

  ## The Struck Ideal String

  When you play a piano note, the string is struck with a hammer. So it's worth thinking about what happens when an ideal string is struck and given an initial velocity.

  The solution for the ideal struck string becomes

  $$
  y = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin (k_n x) \sin(\omega_n t)
  $$

  where $k_n = \frac{n \pi}{L}$ and $\omega_n = c \frac{n \pi}{L}$.

  To solve for $B_n$, we need to use the fact that we know the initial velocity distribution $g(x)$.

  $$
  g(x) = \dot{y} (x,0)
  $$

  Taking the time derivative and substituting in $k_n$, we arrive at

  $$
  g(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \omega_n \sin (\frac{n \pi x}{L})
  $$

  Once again, this equation is solvable using Fourier's trick, resulting in the solution

  $$
  B_n = \frac{2}{\omega_n L} \int_{0}^{L} g(x) \sin (\frac{n \pi x}{L}) dx
  $$

  For example, suppose that we strike the string with a velocity impulse concetrated at a point located a distance $l$ along the string. This would be like striking the string with the edge of a knife. We can model this velocity distribution as a delta function, which you can think of as striking the string with an infinitely thin hammer.

  $$ g(x) = v L \delta (x-l) $$

  Where $v$ is the speed with which the string is struck, and the delta function $\delta (x-l)$ has the property that $ \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \delta (x - l) dx = f(l) $ if $0 \leq l \leq L$. (The extra factor of L is there to make the units work out.)

  Performing the integral, we arrive at the solution

  $$
  B_n = \frac{2 v}{\omega_n} \sin (\frac{n \pi l}{L})
  $$

  Let's animate this solution for the first $N$ terms in the sum.

  $$ y(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} B_n \sin (k_n x) \sin(\omega_n t)$$


</md>

<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Strike position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, N, l) {
  let c = 0.375;
  let v = 0.5;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=N; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (2 * v / w) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    y += a * Math.sin(k * x) * Math.sin(w * t);

  }

  return y;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
  If you strike the string near one of its ends, you can watch the pulse propagating along the string, and reflecting off the ends.

  Once again, let's visualize the waveform. We can obtain the waveform by throwing away the spatial part of the string motion, and only holding on to the time-dependent part.

  $$
    w(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} B_n \sin(\omega_n t)
  $$
</md>

<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Strike position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, N, l) {
  let c = 0.375;
  let v = 0.5;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=N; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (2 * v / w) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    y += a * Math.sin(w * x * 20);

  }

  return y/1.5;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
  Here's what this sounds like, after adding in an exponential fade.
</md>

<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Strike position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}">

  <div class="center-inline">
    <div> Fundamental Frequency = {{freq}} </div> &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <input type="range" :min="110" :max="440" :step="1" v-model.number="freq"></input>
  </div>

  <sound :sin="struckString" :freq="freq" :N="string.N"></sound>

</animation>


<md>
  The struck string has a slightly harsher / brighter sound than the plucked string. This is because it has more energy in higher harmonics. The amplitudes corresponding to the $n^{\text{th}}$ harmonic in the plucked string fall off as $A_n \propto \frac{1}{n^2}$, but in the struck string they fall off as $B_n \propto \frac{1}{n}$.

  Unfortunately, this doesn't sound very piano like. We can try and see what happens if we replace the infinitely narrow hammer strike with a finite-width hammer.

  ## Varying the Strike Width

  In this case, we can imagine that the initial velocity of the string is

  $$
  g(x) = \begin{cases}
     v & \text{if } l - \frac{\delta}{2} \leq x \leq l + \frac{\delta}{2} \\
     0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

  This equation is visualized in the interactive below. Note that this is a graph of the initial *velocity* of the string, not its initial position.
</md>


<animation :vars="hammercurve" :sliders="{l: ['Strike Position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01], d: ['Hammer Width', 0.01, 1, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, l, d) {

  return ((l - d/2 <= x) && (x <= l + d/2)) ? 1 : 0;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
  Plugging this into our equation for $B_n$, we find that in the case of a finite-width hammer, the coefficients are

  $$
    B_n = \frac{2 v}{\omega} \sin(\frac{n \pi l}{L}) \frac{2}{n \pi} \sin(\frac{n \pi \delta}{2L})
  $$

  Here's what the string motion looks like when struck by this kind of a hammer.
</md>

<animation :vars="hammercurve" :sliders="{l: ['Strike Position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01], d: ['Hammer Width', 0.01, 1, 0.01]}" :code="`

  let c = 0.375;
  let v = 0.5;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=10; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (2 * v / w) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    a *= Math.sin(n * Math.PI * d/2) * 2 / (n * Math.PI);

    y += a * Math.sin(k * x) * Math.sin(w * t);

  }

  return y/d;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
  When the hammer is very thin, the resulting motion looks exactly the same as the delta function impulse. When we broaden the hammer, the pulse becomes wider and is more smoothed out in appearance.

  The waveform for this string motion is shown below.
</md>


<animation :vars="hammercurve" :sliders="{l: ['Strike Position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01], d: ['Hammer Width', 0.01, 1, 0.01]}" :code="`

  let c = 0.375;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=10; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (2 / w) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    a *= Math.sin(n * Math.PI * d/2) * 2 / (n * Math.PI);

    y += a * Math.sin(w * x * 20);

  }

  return y/(2 * d);
}

<md>
  For a thin hammer strike, the sound has a harsh attack, and sounds just like the first struck string (where we used an infinitely thin hammer). However, as we increase the hammer size, the sound becomes more like the plucked string.

  In either case we can hear that the sound isn't particularly piano like. In more realistic physics-based piano models, the interaction between the piano and the string is considered more carefully.
