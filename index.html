  # Making Music with Math
  ### A Guide to Synthesizing Sounds with the Wave Equation

  When you pluck a guitar string, or play a key on a piano, the sound is created by a vibrating string. The [wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation) tells us exactly how an idealized string will vibrate at every moment in time after the string is released. Using this equation, it's possible to simulate the motion of a vibrating string, and extract musical sounds directly from this motion. Let's see how we can do this.

  ## The Wave Equation

  Let $y(x,t)$ represent the string's height, plotted as a function of distance $x$ along the string, at any moment in time $t$. You can think of $y(x, t)$ as a graph of the string's motion. As we increment $t$, the graph becomes an animation.

  The wave equation requires that every point on this graph must satisfy

  $$ \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} $$

  Or, more concisely,

  $$\ddot{y} = c^2 y''$$

  where $c$ is the speed of the travelling wave moving along the string.

  In words, this says that the vertical acceleration of every point on the string is proportional to the curvature at that point. In this picture, we're ignoring both energy loss from friction as well as any stiffness in the string.

  We also need the string to be fixed at its ends, i.e.

  $$ y_n(0,t) = 0 $$
  $$ y_n(L,t) = 0 $$

  The solution to this set of requirements is

  $$ y_n = \sin (k_n x) \big( A_n \cos(\omega_n t) + B_n \sin(\omega_n t) \big)$$

  where $k_n = \frac{n \pi}{L}$, $\omega_n = c \frac{n \pi}{L}$, $n = 1,2,3,...$, and $A_n$ and $B_n$ are coefficients to be determined.

  With a little calculus, you can verify that these solutions obey the wave equation, so long as $\omega_n^2 = c^2 k_n^2$. You can also verify that the string is indeed fixed at the ends, as required.

  The $y_n$ provided by the above equation are known as the *normal modes* of the string. These represent the most fundamental ways in which a string can vibrate.

  Let's visualize what the first few of these normal modes look like.
</md>

<animation :vars="stringnormalmodes" :sliders="{n: ['Mode Number', 1, 6, 1]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, n, a, b) {
  let k = n * Math.PI;
  let c = 0.375;
  let w = c * k;

  return Math.sin(k * x) * (a * Math.sin(w * t) + b * Math.cos(w * t))/n;
}

`">
</animation>

<md>
  As we increase $n$, the string oscillates more rapidly. The frequency of vibration of each normal mode $f_n$ is related to $\omega_n$ by $f_n = \frac{\omega_n}{2 \pi}$. Plugging in $\omega_n = c \frac{n \pi}{L}$, we find that $f = n \frac{c}{2 L} = n f$.

  It's worth pausing to notice what just happened. We asked the wave equation to make sure that the string ends are fixed, and the wave equation came back and told us that the string can *only* vibrate at a very specific set of frequencies.

  In the case of the ideal string, these allowable frequencies are integer multiples of a fundamental frequency (i.e f, 2f, 3f, ...). Together, these frequencies are known as the *harmonics* of the string.

  ## Mixing Modes of Vibration

  The wave equation is a **linear equation**, which means that if $y_1$ is a solution and $y_2$ is a solution, then any combination of the form $a y_1 + b y_2$ is also a solution to the wave equation. The key point here is that *mixtures of solutions to the wave equation are also themselves solutions*.

  So we can obtain more complex patterns of string vibration by mixing together different normal modes.

  Here, try it out for yourself. When you're done mixing, turn up the speed slider to unfreeze the wave, and watch its ensuing motion.
</md>

<animation :vars="mixingmodes" :sliders="{A1: ['1st mode', -1, 1, 0.01], A2: ['2nd mode', -1, 1, 0.01], A3: ['3rd mode', -1, 1, 0.01], A4: ['4th mode', -1, 1, 0.01], A5: ['5th mode', -1, 1, 0.01], A6: ['6th mode', -1, 1, 0.01], c: ['Speed', 0, 1, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, c, ...a) {

  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=6; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    y += Math.sin(k * x) * (a[n-1] * Math.cos(w * t))
  }

  return y/6;
}

`">
</animation>

<md>
  In the interactive above you can drag the sliders to mix in different amounts of the first 6 normal modes (we're adjusting the $A_n$ coefficients here, the $B_n$ coefficients are set to zero). Every setting of these sliders is a different, perfectly valid solution to the wave equation.

  A somewhat amazing fact is that essentially any string shape can be expressed as a sum of different normal modes. So, the most general type of string vibration is

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
     y &= y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + \ldots \\
     &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty y_n
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  Or,
  $$
  y = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin (k_n x) \big( A_n \cos(\omega_n t) + B_n \sin(\omega_n t) \big)
  $$

  where $k_n = \frac{n \pi}{L}$, $\omega_n = c \frac{n \pi}{L}$, and $c$ is the speed of the travelling wave in the string.

  Solving the wave equation in a particular situation amounts to working out the coefficients $A_n$ and $B_n$. Once we know these coefficients, we can plug them into the equation above to obtain a graph of every point on the string for all time.

  ## Fourier's Trick

  But how do we find these coefficients? To do this, we need to know something more about the string. In particular, we need to know the **initial position** and the **initial velocity** of the string, represented by $y(x,0)$ and $\dot{y}(x,0)$.

  Going back to the equation for $y(x,t)$, we can plug in $t=0$ to find that

  $$
  y(x,0) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty A_n \sin (\frac{n \pi x}{L})
  $$

  Similarly, if we take a time derivative before plugging in $t=0$, we find that

  $$
  \dot{y}(x,0) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty B_n \omega_n \sin (\frac{n \pi x}{L})
  $$

  To solve these for $A_n$ and $B_n$, we can use the classic [Fourier trick](https://books.google.com/books?id=Kh4xDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA134&dq=Fourier%27s+trick+griffiths&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwib2eD80_blAhWLjFkKHY8YB9oQ6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q&f=false) of multiplying both sides of the equation by $ \sin (\frac{m \pi x}{L}) $ and integrating over x.

  Doing so, we arrive at equations for $A_n$ and $B_n$.

  $$ A_n =  \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} y(x,0) \sin (\frac{n \pi x}{L}) dx$$

  $$B_n = \frac{2}{\omega_n L} \int_{0}^{L} \dot{y}(x,0) \sin (\frac{n \pi x}{L}) dx$$

  This solves the ideal string. Notice that $A_n$ only depends on the initial position of the string, while $B_n$ only depends on the initial velocity. If we plug in formulas for $y(x,0)$ and $\dot{y}(x,0)$ into these integrals, we obtain $A_n$ and $B_n$.

  Then,

  $$
  y(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin (k_n x) \big( A_n \cos(\omega_n t) + B_n \sin(\omega_n t) \big)
  $$

  tells us the subsequent motion of the string.

  To summarize, if we know *exactly* how the string started off (i.e. its initial position and its initial velocity), then we can calculate everything about its subsequent motion.


  ## The Plucked String

  When you play a note on a guitar, you pluck the string and give it an initial shape. For a purely plucked string, the initial velocity of the string is zero. Since $\dot{y}(x,0) = 0$, this tells us that $B_n = 0$.

  The solution for the ideal plucked string reduces to

  $$
  y = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \sin (k_n x) \cos(\omega_n t)
  $$

  where $k_n = \frac{n \pi}{L}$ and $\omega_n = c \frac{n \pi}{L}$. So we just need to find $A_n$.

  Say that the string is plucked at a length $l$ along the string, with an initially triangular string shape.

  $$
  y(x,0) = \begin{cases}
     h \frac{x}{l} & \text{if } x \leq l \\
     h \frac{L - x}{L - l} & \text{if } l < x \leq L
  \end{cases}
  $$

  Here's what this function for the plucked guitar string shape looks like.
</md>


<animation :vars="trianglecurve" :sliders="{l: ['Pluck position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01], h: ['Pluck height', -1, 1, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, l, h) {
  return x <= l ? h * x/l : h * (1 - x) / (1-l);
}

`"></animation>

<md>

  We can plug this function into to our integral for $A_n$, and use a tool like Wolfram Alpha to solve the integral. The [solution](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282%2FL%29*%28Integrate%5Bsin%28n+pi+x+%2F+L%29+*+h*x%2Fl%2C%7Bx%2C0%2Cl%7D%5D+%2B+Integrate%5Bsin%28n+pi+x+%2F+L%29+*+h*%281-x%2FL%29*%28L%2F%28L-l%29%29%2C%7Bx%2Cl%2CL%7D%5D%29)  is

  $$ A_n = \frac{1}{n^2 \pi^2} \frac{2 h L^2}{l (L- l)}  \sin(\frac{n \pi l}{L})$$

  Let's animate this solution for the first $N$ terms in the sum.

  $$ y(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \sin (k_n x) \cos(\omega_n t)$$

</md>

<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Pluck position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, N, l) {
  let c = 0.375;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=N; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (1/Math.pow((n*Math.PI),2)) * (2/(l * (1-l))) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    y += a * Math.sin(k * x) * Math.cos(w * t);

  }

  return y;
}

`"></animation>

<md>

  The animation above shows the motion of the string following the initial pluck (with $h$ set to $1$). Notice that the string motion is periodic, as the string returns to its starting position and repeats the motion.

  The next step is to extract an audio waveform from this string motion. For the waveform $w(t)$, we want only the time-dependent part of the string motion.

  $$ w(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \cos(\omega_n t)$$

</md>

<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Pluck position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, N, l) {

  let c = 0.375;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=N; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (1/Math.pow((n * Math.PI),2)) * (2/(l * (1-l))) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    y += a * Math.cos(w * x * 20);

  }

  return y/1.5;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
  The interactive above shows you the waveform for the plucked string. Notice how it changs depending on where you pluck the string.

  To make sound with this waveform, we first need to do a couple of things.

  - Rewrite $\omega_n$ in terms of the fundamental frequency of the tone, so $\omega_n = 2 \pi n f$.
  - A real plucked string has a sound that fades. To model this, we need the string to dissipate energy. One way to do this is to ensure that each sine or cosine function decays exponentially, with a decay time $\tau_n$ that depends on its frequency (higher frequencies fade faster than lower ones). Following [this reference](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2007/ph210/pelc2/), we can choose $\tau_n = \frac{\tau}{n}$ where $\tau$ is a characteristic fade time (in seconds).


  Making these changes, we end up with the following waveform.

  $$ w(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \cos(2 \pi n f t) e ^{ - n t / \tau }$$

  Here's what this sounds like.
</md>


<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Pluck position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}">

  </div>

  <sound :sin="pluckedString" :freq="freq" :N="string.N"></sound>

</animation>

<md>
  Notice that as the pluck position moves towards the edge of the string, the sound becomes brighter.

  ## The Struck String

  When you play a piano note, the string is struck with a hammer. So it's worth thinking about what happens when an ideal string is struck.

  In a purely struck string, the string starts off at rest, but with a non-zero intial velocity.

  Since $y(x,0) = 0$, this implies that $A_n = 0$.

  So the solution for the ideal struck string reduces to

  $$
  y = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin (k_n x) \sin(\omega_n t)
  $$

  where $k_n = \frac{n \pi}{L}$ and $\omega_n = c \frac{n \pi}{L}$. To solve for $B_n$, we need to use the fact that we know the initial velocity $\dot{y}(x,0)$.

  Suppose that we strike the string with a velocity impulse concentrated at a point located a distance $l$ along the string. This would be like striking the string with the edge of a knife. We can model this velocity distribution as a delta function, which you can think of as striking the string with an infinitely thin hammer.

  $$ \dot{y}(x,0) = v L \delta (x-l) $$

  Here $v$ is the speed with which the string is struck, and the delta function $\delta (x-l)$ has the property that $ \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \delta (x - l) dx = f(l) $ if $0 \leq l \leq L$. (The extra factor of L is there to make the units work out.)

  Performing the integral for $B_n$, we arrive at the solution

  $$
  B_n = \frac{2 v}{\omega_n} \sin (\frac{n \pi l}{L})
  $$

  Let's animate this solution for the first $N$ terms in the sum.

  $$ y(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} B_n \sin (k_n x) \sin(\omega_n t)$$


</md>

<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Strike position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, N, l) {
  let c = 0.375;
  let v = 0.5;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=N; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (2 * v / w) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    y += a * Math.sin(k * x) * Math.sin(w * t);

  }

  return y;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
  If you strike the string near one of its ends, you can watch the pulse propagating along the string, and reflecting off the ends!

  Once again, let's visualize the waveform. We can obtain the waveform by throwing away the spatial part of the string motion, and only holding on to the time-dependent part.

  $$
    w(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} B_n \sin(\omega_n t)
  $$
</md>

<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Strike position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, N, l) {
  let c = 0.375;
  let v = 0.5;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=N; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (2 * v / w) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    y += a * Math.sin(w * x * 20);

  }

  return y/1.5;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
  Here's what this sounds like, after adding in an exponential fade.
</md>

<animation :vars="string" :sliders="{N: ['Number of terms', 1, 10, 1], l: ['Strike position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01]}">

  </div>

  <sound :sin="struckString" :freq="freq" :N="string.N"></sound>

</animation>


<md>
  The struck string has a slightly harsher / brighter sound than the plucked string. This is because it has more energy in higher harmonics. The amplitudes corresponding to the $n^{\text{th}}$ harmonic in the plucked string fall off as $A_n \propto \frac{1}{n^2}$, but in the struck string they fall off as $B_n \propto \frac{1}{n}$.

  Unfortunately, this doesn't sound very piano like. We can try and see what happens if we replace the infinitely narrow hammer strike with a finite-width hammer.

  ## Varying the Strike Width

  In this case, imagine that the initial velocity of the string is

  $$
  \dot{y}(x,0) = \begin{cases}
     v & \text{if } l - \frac{\delta}{2} \leq x \leq l + \frac{\delta}{2} \\
     0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

  This is visualized in the interactive below. Note that this is a graph of the initial *velocity* of the string, not its initial position.
</md>


<animation :vars="hammercurve" :sliders="{l: ['Strike Position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01], d: ['Hammer Width', 0.01, 1, 0.01]}" :code="`

function graph(x, t, l, d) {

  return ((l - d/2 <= x) && (x <= l + d/2)) ? 1 : 0;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
  Plugging this into our equation for $B_n$, we find that in the case of a finite-width hammer, the coefficients are

  $$
    B_n = \frac{2 v}{\omega} \sin(\frac{n \pi l}{L}) \frac{2}{n \pi} \sin(\frac{n \pi \delta}{2L})
  $$

  Here's what the string motion looks like when struck by this kind of a hammer.
</md>

<animation :vars="hammercurve" :sliders="{l: ['Strike Position', 0.1, 0.9, 0.01], d: ['Hammer Width', 0.01, 1, 0.01]}" :code="`

  let c = 0.375;
  let v = 0.5;
  let y = 0;

  for (let n=1; n<=10; n++) {
    let k = n * Math.PI;
    let w = c * k;
    let a = (2 * v / w) * Math.sin(n * Math.PI * l);

    a *= Math.sin(n * Math.PI * d/2) * 2 / (n * Math.PI);

    y += a * Math.sin(k * x) * Math.sin(w * t);

  }

  return y/d;
}

`"></animation>

<md>
  When the hammer is very thin, the resulting motion looks exactly the same as the delta function impulse. When we broaden the hammer, the pulse becomes wider and is more smoothed out in appearance.

  The waveform for this string motion is shown below.

    let w = c * k;

    a *= Math.sin(n * Math.PI * d/2) * 2 / (n * Math.PI);

<md>
  For a thin hammer strike, the sound has a harsh attack, and sounds just like the first struck string (where we used an infinitely thin hammer). However, as we increase the hammer size, the sound becomes more like the plucked string.

  In either case we can hear that the sound isn't particularly piano like. It turns out that the interaction between a piano hammer and the string is more complicated than a simple 'kick' of velocity. In more realistic physics-based piano models, the interaction between the piano and the string is considered more carefully.
